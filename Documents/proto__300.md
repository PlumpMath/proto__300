# `proto_300` particulars:

This is a skeleton system that should be generally adaptible to a variety of applications.  For illustration we'll make a proto-user app that has some functions like:

- mock a bunch of data and random data streams over redis.

- proto-user can request data about the data streams, some graphing functionalities

- some social functionalities, chat, msg
