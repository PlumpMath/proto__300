We need to push structured log data to the Redis log across the stack in a way that is independent of State.  For this particular side-effect, we don't want to have to go to the Side--Effect function to affect, we want to do this as quickly as possible, without causing disruption to the flow.

We want to push the information to brujo--terminal, but this may not need happen so soon as we think.  This is something that has to come out of Reducer/Side--Effect collaboration.



So maybe there would be no additional transcendents introduced at this level, since the recovery, reduction of the cache takes place immanently rather than transcendently.

It's just: pop/clear the whole cache, put it through a reducer, and spark-write it to the client.
